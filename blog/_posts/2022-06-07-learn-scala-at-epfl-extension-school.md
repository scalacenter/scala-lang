title: Learn Scala Online at the EPFL Extension School

We are very excited to announce that our MOOC “Effective Programming in 
Scala” is now also available on the Extension School platform!

## The Extension School Platform

Currently, [our MOOCs][moocs] are published on Coursera or edX. Every year, 
tens of thousands of programmers take our courses! We are very proud to teach 
Scala at such a scale, but we also feel some challenges in teaching online. 
Indeed, for some people, learning alone behind a computer does not work well. 
When the learners see a test that does not pass, or a compiler error message, they 
have to figure out what’s wrong almost exclusively on their own.

The [Extension School][exts] is an online learning platform that addresses 
this issue. At the Extension School, the learners get **individual support** 
from course instructors. They have access to regular live sessions where 
they can ask specific questions to the course instructors, and their work is 
reviewed by Scala experts (not only by an automated grader).

We believe that both types of platforms are complementary and target 
different needs, this is why we decided to publish the course Effective 
Programming in Scala on both Coursera and the Extension School.

## Effective Programming in Scala

The course [Effective Programming in Scala] is the first of our MOOCs to be 
published to the Extension School. This course teaches programmers with no 
experience in Scala everything they need to be ready to work in Scala. It’s 
a good choice for companies that need to train new hires, or for individuals 
willing to apply for a Scala job.

The content of the course is the same as on Coursera: it contains video 
lectures, quizzes, and auto-graded homeworks. The course is self-paced: you 
start whenever you are available, and you progress at your own pace. 
Additionally, every week you have access to 30 minutes of live sessions with 
instructors, and your final project will be reviewed by Scala experts.

We are looking forward to seeing you online!
